Admin Panel has working functionality for adding, deleting or editing news articles. Admin panel is only accessible for admin users who
are only created programatically.

NOTE! The text fields for the ADD section should be filled out when adding an article (it sometimes bugs out if all fields are empty)
Other than that, no bugs have been found
